      Foggyou helps property owners secure their valuables and premises in the
      event of a theft crime. Their solution is a self-fitted fog cannon device
      that produces thick harmless fog in seconds when activated remotely,
      making criminal activities impossible to take place.

      As an information architect &amp; UI developer, I am responsible for
      planning and designing the website structure, implementing the final
      design, developing and testing the final product.
    </p>
    <h3>Collaboration</h3>
    <p>
      I work closely with{" "}
      <AnimatedAnchor href="//teperspective.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        TE PERSPECTIVE
      </AnimatedAnchor>
      , who is leading the project in the aspect of branding, along with the content
      team of professionals in various disciplines including copywriting, photography,
      and videography.

      We distilled the client&apos;s goals into two primary goals of the
      website:
    </p>
    <List gap="8px">
      <li>
        To sell fog cannon devices &amp; parts directly to consumers (product),
      </li>
      <li>To sign up global retailers as distributors (awareness).</li>
    </List>
    <p>
      Two user groups were then identified to be (1) owners of a premise who
      want to protect their valuables and operators, and (2) retailers for
      product distribution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Users would expect to learn about a fog cannon device and Foggyou,
      purchase the fog cannon device &amp; replacement parts, and for retailers
      to register their interest to become a distributor, all through the
      website.

    <p>
      E-commerce sites are relatively large. We were quick to agree on the
      modular design approach to ensure the scalability of our design.
    </p>
    <p>
      I laid out the order&ndash;checkout flow of an e-commerce site early on to
      better communicate the scope and user flow with the designers, which we
      all appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also outlined some other specifications to meet specific user goals,
      i.e.
    </p>
    <List gap="8px">
      <li>
        Country-specific sites to serve local content (geolocation and
        multilingual support),
      </li>
      <li>
        Landing page(s) for retailers to register their interest to become a
        distributor,
      </li>
      <li>
        Coming Soon page with an email sign-up form is displayed to capture
        early interest.
      </li>
    </List>

    <h2>User Flows</h2>
    <p>
      We created two sets of user flows to meet the needs of each user group
      respectively.
    </p>
    <h3>Customers</h3>

    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      With well-defined user flows, several key and fundamental pages and their
      information were identified. The information is then organized to map out
      its relationship, hierarchy, and navigation, in a way that is intuitive to
      humans, as well as web crawler(s).

    <h2>Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      With a design system in place, I began the front-end development process.
      Here is an overview.
    </p>
    <h3>I define the theme.</h3>
    <p>
      In a theme, style properties such as colours and typography are defined
      globally as variables, which its value can then be referenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fonts, web or custom, are imported locally at this point, which in this
      case is the latter.
    </p>
    <h3>I build reusable components for the layout.</h3>
    <p>
      I prioritize the components that form the layout of the website, which are
      commonly the header and footer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smaller components such as menus, buttons, and links are then introduced
      that eventually form a library.
    </p>
    <Figure
      alt="Demonstrating atomic design"
      image={getImage(props.localImages[4])}
    />
    <h3>I build the page components, then onto content templates.</h3>
    <p>
      With a sizable component library comprising the basic elements, I proceed
      to the larger parts of the complex unit, pages &amp; templates.
    </p>
    <h3>I test the website for production.</h3>
    <p>
      I ensure the website is rendered consistently by testing for compatibility
      with developer tools that are built into different browsers, as well as
      mobile responsiveness by viewing the website on various screen sizes and
      devices in responsive design mode.

      We created a delightful e-commerce experience for Foggyou that is
      optimized across platforms and implemented their new identity thoughtfully
      at every touchpoint.
    </p>
    <h3>Takeaway</h3>
    <p>
      A design system with unified design practices and implementation in mind
      is a key to creating a cohesive and accessible product.
    </p>
    <p>
      It results in a clear visual hierarchy in the overall product and semantic
      HTML can be implemented effectively.
