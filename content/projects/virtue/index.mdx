      Opening a bank account is typically done over the counter and the approach
      remains the same for the longest time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process by most conventional banks requires customers to be present at
      one of their branches, creating inconveniences that Virtue is set to
      address with an online approach.

    <h2>Understand the Users</h2>
    <p>
      I asked around in my circle of friends about their experience opening
      their first bank account. People I talked to are balanced in gender and
      aged between 20 to 27. To my surprise, I discovered that our experiences
      are relatively similar.
    </p>
    <List>
      <li>Most of them got their first account when they were in college.</li>
      <li>
        They recalled going through the typical process of applying at the bank
        branch.
      </li>
      <li>The whole process took them about half their day.</li>
      <li>
        They went with the bank they thought at that time was the most
        convenient to them in terms of ATM and branch availability.
      </li>
      <li>
        Half of them switched to another bank several years later when they
        entered the workforce.
      </li>
    </List>
    <p>
      With the insights that I have gathered from their personal experience, I
      created the following persona.

    <h2>Meet Mia</h2>
    <p>
      Mia (21F) has recently moved to another city for college. As a first-year
      student, she lives in student accommodation and spends most of her time on
      campus.
    </p>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>
      Mia needs a bank account to manage her money and access it later to pay
      for her daily needs.
    </p>
    <h3>Frustration</h3>
    <p>
      Mia finds it inconvenient to visit the bank during the day as she could
      not find the appropriate slot of time.
    </p>

    <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
    <p>
      To better understand Mia&apos;s inconveniences, I mapped out her user
      journey with the help of some interviewees.

      A closer look reveals an inefficient process typically results in hours of
      waiting, e.g., on a commute to the bank, in a queue and collecting the
      card.

      <li>No online account opening service.</li>
      <li>
        The inconvenience of visiting the bank during operation hours which
        requires planning ahead.

    <p>
      At this point, I had a rough idea of the solution that I am designing,
      which I believe to be an app for customers to open a bank account online.
      An online service would address the inconvenience of visiting the bank,
      essentially saving customers&apos; time and money.
    </p>
    <p>
      I revisited the user journey map and came up with some ideas that could
      reduce the waiting time and improve the overall experience.
    </p>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>Product recommendation</strong> based on the user&apos;s profile
        saves users from looking into irrelevant options.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Online application</strong> to save both parties time filling
        out and processing paper forms. Electronic forms also minimise errors
        with input validation features.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Online card activation</strong> provides an alternative to
        physical activation over an ATM.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Appointment booking</strong> creates a seamless customer
        experience resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.

    <h2>Competitive Audit</h2>
    <p>
      I evaluated the process of the two largest national banks in Malaysia,
      Maybank and CIMB Bank, based on the following categories.
    </p>
    <List nostyle>
      <li>
        <h3>Feature</h3>
        <p>
          Maybank accepts online applications via web form; however, they only
          get processed over the counter.
        </p>
        <p>
          CIMB Bank has a separate mobile app called CIMB Apply for online
          account opening. However, the service only applies to their digital
          banking product but excludes the rest of their standard products,
          joint and junior account.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Offerings</h3>
        <p>
          Both offer on average 14 products, most of which are nearly identical
          in terms of features with only noticeable differences such as age
          requirements, card designs, and payment processors.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>
          There is not much to talk about Maybank, except I cannot help but
          notice how long the application form is.
        </p>
        <Figure
          alt="Maybank's online application form"
          image={getImage(props.localImages[2])}
        />
        <p>
          The reviews of the CIMB Apply app reveal various issues affecting more
          than hundreds of users, which many deemed the app unusable.
        </p>
        <p>
          As one would expect, the app is rated poorly, with an average star
          rating of 1.5 out of 5.0 on the iOS App Store and Google Play Store.
        </p>
      </li>
    </List>
    <h3>Gaps</h3>
    <List>
      <li>The account opening process is not fully online.</li>
      <li>Unreliable and incomplete services.</li>
      <li>Products lack differentiating features.</li>
      <li>Poor product browsing experience.</li>
    </List>
    <p>
      I took note of these shortcomings of the existing services and ended with
      more ideas, which is generally a good thing. I then proceeded to
      prioritise the ideas with some goals.
    </p>
  </Col>
</Grid>

<Grid lg="2" rtl>
  <Col>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My primary goal is to design a fully online account opening flow.</p>
    <p>Some design goals are:</p>
    <List>
      <li>To visualise the electronic verification process,</li>
      <li>To improve the product browsing experience,</li>
      <li>To design an interactive form experience.</li>
    </List>
  </Col>
</Grid>

<Grid lg="2" rtl>
  <Col>
    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      I decided that the navigation be sequential to resemble the series of
      actions in the user journey.

    <h3>Designing the signing on flow</h3>
    <p>
      I introduced{" "}
      <AnimatedAnchor
        href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"

        single sign-on (SSO)
      </AnimatedAnchor>{" "}
      to streamline the onboarding flow, given that each application is unique
      and processed only once.
    </p>
    <Figure
      alt="Demonstrating signing on flow"
      image={getImage(props.localImages[4])}
    />
    <p>The sign-on flow involves the following steps of verification.</p>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>Enter a phone number</strong> to check for an existing
        application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enter age</strong> to check the user&apos;s eligibility and
        recommend relevant products.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Enter the one-time password (OTP)</strong> for authentication.
      </li>
    </List>
    <Figure alt="Signing on flow" image={getImage(props.localImages[5])} />
    <h3>Visualising the identity verification flow</h3>
    <p>
      To verify the user&apos;s identity, users would take a picture of their
      primary ID document and a self-portrait for identification.
    </p>
    <p>
      I designed the system to have the ability to interpret and extract the
      information from the ID document accurately. If feasible, it would save
      users from entering them later.

    <h2>Design Changes &amp; Refinements</h2>
    <h3>Presented products in a scrollable carousel.</h3>
    <p>
      Browsing from a list can be distracting when it gets long. A carousel
      helps users distinguish differences as they move through the products. The
      new layout creates more space for information which was not possible with
      a list.
    </p>
    <Figure
      alt="New product browsing experience"
      image={getImage(props.localImages[7])}
    />
    <h3>
      Added a toggle to reveal the necessary information about the application
      on the launch screen
    </h3>
    <p>It gives users a quick overview before committing to the user flow.</p>
    <Figure alt="App overview modal" image={getImage(props.localImages[8])} />
    <h3>Created the navigation tab</h3>
    <p>
      Most users were seen struggling to navigate the flow back and forth due to
      the inconsistent placement of the navigational controls.
    </p>
    <p>
      To adddress the issue, a navigation tab with a back button is added on
      most screens. In addition, the controls used for advancement, i.e. the
      'Procced' button, is fixed at the bottom of the screen.
    </p>
    <p>Changes made to address the issue:</p>
    <List>
      <li>A navigation tab with a back button is present on most screens.</li>
      <li>
        The control used for advancement, i.e. the 'Proceed' button, is fixed at
        the bottom of the screen.
      </li>
    </List>
    <Figure alt="New app navigation" image={getImage(props.localImages[9])} />
    <h3>Added a progress indicator</h3>
    <p>
      It provides users with a sense of progress and motivates them to complete
      the flow.
    </p>
    <Figure alt="Progress indicator" image={getImage(props.localImages[10])} />
    <h3>Dynamic home screen</h3>
    <p>
      The home screen is where users start the main flow and return to continue
      or check their application. It should feel personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The content of the header adapts based on the user&apos;s applications
      status to welcome, encourage progress and celebrate success.

    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
    <p>
      The visual identity for Virtue seeks to appeal to the younger audience. I
      began exploring the name Virtue. It appears to be a concept traces back to
      the Greco-Roman period, which is the theme the identity is based off.

    <Figure alt="Typography system" image={getImage(props.localImages[13])} />

  <Col>
    <p>
      Symbolic objects from that period inspire the base colour palette, i.e.
      green from laurel wreath and ivory from Greek/Roman columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for typography, I paired{" "}

        Public Sans
      </AnimatedAnchor>{" "}
      to create a balanced combination/pairing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fahkwang is effective at adding visual interest to headlines with its
      expressive and light-hearted characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an all-capital setting, spacing out the letters resembles the inscribed
      texts on the surface of Romain columns.

    <Figure
      alt="Transformation of logotype"

      Public Sans is legible as body text and space-saving due to its condensed
      appearance.

      Examining one's experience from their perspectives helped me learn about
      the users' general preference for convenience, which I made sure to
      prioritise in my design process. I also learned about various concepts of
      user behaviour and product design in the process.
