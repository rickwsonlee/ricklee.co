description: "I was intrigued when TE PERSPECTIVE first approached me about Foggyou. It was unlike the fog machine that I had once operated at a school performance as a stagehand. It is for serious business. Literally."

      Believing that prevention is better than cure, Foggyou helps property
      owners secure their valuables and premises in the event of a theft crime.
      Their solution is a self-fitted fog cannon device that produces thick
      harmless fog in seconds when activated remotely, making criminal
      activities impossible to take place.

      Working with TE PERSPECTIVE, we have created an e-commerce experience for
      Foggyou, that is not only delightful but also optimized across platforms,
      while thoughtfully implementing their new identity at every touchpoint.
