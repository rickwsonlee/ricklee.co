      Foggyou helps property owners secure their valuables and premises in the
      event of a theft crime. Their solution is a self-fitted fog cannon device
      that produces thick harmless fog in seconds when activated remotely,
      making criminal activities impossible to take place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working with TE PERSPECTIVE, we have created an e-commerce experience for
      Foggyou, that is not only delightful but also optimized across platforms,
      while thoughtfully implementing their new identity at every touchpoint.

      The full case study is to be published. Branding is done by TE
      PERSPECTIVE.{" "}
