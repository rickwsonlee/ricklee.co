    <p>
      Tabtiv is a client billing app for fitness trainers to create and send
      invoices to clients. It is set to address the difficulities busy fitness
      trainers faced to keep up with their clients' payment schedule.

    <Label transparent>Role</Label>
  </Col>
  <Col>
    <p>
      As a UX designer and researcher, my responsibilities consist of conducting
      interviews &amp; usability studies, paper and digital wireframing, low-
      and high-fidelity prototyping.
    </p>

<Grid lg="2">

    <Label transparent>User Research</Label>
  </Col>
  <Col>
    <p>
      User research indicated that our primary user group is new or freelance
      fitness trainers that are looking to better manage and grow their
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common problems that they often faced when billing clients the manual way
      such as personalized client's package which makes preparing invoices even
      time-consuming, keeping up with their payments, and collecting payments,
      sometimes in-person, and processing multiple kindd of payments, both
      physically and electronically.
    </p>
  </Col>
  <Col></Col>
  <Col>
    <h3>Pain Points</h3>
    <List gap="8px">
      <li>
        Initial Setup: Setting up the system and template documents are often
        required for the first time.
      </li>
      <li>Time: The process is manual and time-consuming.</li>
      <li>
        Collection: Traveling between facilities makes it difficult to collect
        payments in person.
      </li>
      <li>
        Process: Each client has their preferred payment methods which makes
        processing and tracking these payments even tedious.
      </li>
    </List>
    <p>From user research, I created the persona and a problem statement.</p>

    <h2>Meet Michelle</h2>
    <p>
      Michelle is a 24F, living in the capital city of Malaysia, KL. She works
      part-time as a personal trainer for over 3 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Goal: She is working toward making personal training her full-time career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frustration: She has a busy schedule and wants to prioritize delivering
      effective programs.
    </p>
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Michelle is a new freelance personal trainer who needs an efficient way to
      bill and communicates with her clients on payments because she has a busy
      schedule and wants to prioritize delivering effective training programs to
      her clients.

    <h3>Michelle's User Journey</h3>

      The user journey map reveals the daily routine of a fitness trainer and
      that a quick and easy way to request and manage clients' payments would
      increase her productivity.

    <h2>Paper</h2>
    <p>
      For the first screen of the app, I ensured to address one of the user pain
      points immediately: time. I prioritized the user flow of sending an
      invoice with quick entry points, such as a Create action button and pinned
      clients to quick-send invoices, while providing access to useful
      information and analytics.

    <h2>Digital</h2>
    <p>
      I then shifted my focus to the navigation system and information
      hierarchy.

    <p>
      One of the key tasks in the user flow is creating the invoice. I
      translated a standard invoice template into a single, customizable input
      form, with the ability to generate for two different payment models:
      one-time and recurring, which are the common billing methods.

    <h3>Low-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
    <p>
      A low-fidelity prototype is created with the wireframe to demonstrate user
      paths in the user flow.

    <p>
      I conducted two rounds of unmoderated usability studies with the low- and
      high-fidelity prototype respectively.
    </p>
    <p>Both rounds reveal several insights in which users want:</p>
    <List gap="8px" as="ol">
      <li>An intuitive way to edit and glance through details,</li>
      <li>Button text to be descriptive,</li>

    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
    <p>
      To address the final insight, I re-designed the design system. The new
      system took most of the references from Apple's{" "}
      <AnimatedAnchor
        href="//developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/overview/themes/"

      . It has especially transformed Tabtiv's visual hierarchy and touch points
      tremendously.

    <h3>High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>

      The user flow has been further refined on the high-fidelity prototype with
      the improved visual hierarchy.

      I interacted with prototypes on an actual device using the Figma app to
      test for real-world usability. With the test I managed to improve and
      optimise the touch targets on the final prototype.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>
      Tabtiv met the goal it set to allow users to generate a bill, a task that
      would normally require access to an office suite, now easier from their
      mobile phones.
    </p>
    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>
      Product design is an iterative process. Revisiting the drawing board with
      new perspectives is crucial at any stage of the product development cycle.
