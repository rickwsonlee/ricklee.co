    <h2>Meet Mia</h2>
    <p>
      Mia is a 24F, living in the capital city of Malaysia, KL. She is soon
      graduating from college and will be entering the job market.

    <p>Goal: Land an entry-level job that meet her expectations.</p>
    <p>
      Frustration: Uncertain of where to begin, Abundance of job portal
      platforms
    </p>
    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>
      Mia is a soon-to-be graduate who needs an reliable method or tool for job
      searching because she is uncertain of where to begin.
    </p>

      onboarding to exploring listings and applying a job.

      I conducted an unmoderated usability studies with the low-fidelity
      prototype and these are the insights uncovered from the usability study:

    <List gap="8px" as="ol">
      <li>Users want an efficient way to set up their profile,</li>
      <li>Users want to explore new listings quicker,</li>
      <li>
        Users want to explore as many listings as possible while navigating
        through them.

      The onboarding form provides input suggestions based of their previous
      information from the last step (in this case, job titles relevant to
      user&apos;s education), while allowing manual input.

      I interacted with prototypes on an actual device using the Figma app to
      test for real-world usability. With the test I managed to improve and
      optimise the touch targets on the final prototype.
