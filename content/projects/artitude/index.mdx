      The designers at Artitude Design Studio (aka Design Something) produce
      interiors that embody purposeful concepts and well-thought designs that
      stand the test of time. Having worked closely with them, their commitment
      and attention to detail are admirable.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was approached to develop a portfolio website as part of their ongoing
      effort to build their online presence. My tasks consist of conducting SEO
      research, structuring content, wire-framing, designing mockups, and a
      fundamental visual identity that reflects their attitudes.

    <p>
      We agreed that the website should be{" "}
      <strong>
        the primary channel for generating leads from various traffics,
        including social media
      </strong>
      , and <strong>creating further interest in their business</strong> with the
      work they showcase.
    </p>
    <h2>Understand the Users</h2>
    <p>
      ADS is known for its specialisation in high-budget residential projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I had never interacted with an interior designer or the user group,
      I worked closely with ADS to gather as much information about their
      workflow, target audience, demographic and buyer&apos;s journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am particularly interested in their client&apos;s intentions and perhaps
      concerns.
    </p>
    <List>
      <li>
        They value self-expression, their lifestyle and the people they share
        the space with.
      </li>
      <li>Most find engaging with interior designers to be intimidating.</li>
    </List>
    <p>
      These insights help inform their brand message of creating functional
      spaces that reflect their client&apos;s personalities and lifestyles while
      accommodating their needs and budget.

    <p>
      I decided to take on the SEO research role, as a learning opportunity to
      explore the topic beyond the basics. Even though SEO revolves around web
      design, it is a different specialisation that I barely explore at that
      point.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a week to prepare, I look up video tutorials to teach myself as much
      about the process. Tutorials specifically from Ahrefs have been a
      tremendous help.
    </p>
    <h3>Strategy</h3>
    <p>
      My goal is to come up with a list of low-competition keywords that meet
      search intents.
    </p>
    <p>
      These keywords, also known as long-tail keywords, tend to be specific key
      phrases with low search volume while effective at generating quality
      traffic.
    </p>
  </Col>

    <h2>Brainstorm Keywords</h2>
    <h3>Competitor Analysis</h3>
    <p>
      We decided to focus on local competition as they primarily serve the
      Penang market. I looked up the first-page competitors on local search
      results using the search term &apos;interior design penang&apos;.
    </p>
    <p>
      I analysed their websites by navigating each and using Ahrefs&apos;s Site
      Explorer to retrieve their SEO statistics and organic keywords.
    </p>
    <List>
      <li>
        <strong>All competitors have a portfolio</strong> with 5 to 25 projects
        listed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1 out of 5 competitors has a blog</strong>, contributing to high
        referring domains due to backlinks.
      </li>
    </List>
    <h3>Keyword Research</h3>
    <p>
      Using the seed keyword, interior design, I looked up search queries in
      Malaysia using Google Trends.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was able to generate a list of relevant search queries, and categorise
      them into common themes and search intents. These categories later act as
      taxonomies of the website to organise content for improved discovery.
    </p>
    <Figure
      alt="Keywords categorised by theme"
      image={getImage(props.localImages[1])}
    />
    <p>
      I also explored some more keywords with Keyword Planner built into Google
      Ads.
    </p>
    <h3>Shortlist Keywords</h3>
    <p>
      I then entered all potential keywords into Ahrefs&apos;s tool to analyse
      the search volume to determine the competition.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also checked selected keywords for any conflict in the definition. One
      of which is &apos;interior designer&apos;, which results in searches on
      job openings that helped inform their identity as an &apos;interior design
      studio&apos; instead.

      I worked with Josie Writes Hub on copywriting, and they did a fantastic
      job.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also defined set guidelines for brand communication to ensure future
      content consistently communicates the brand messages to the target
      audience across all platforms.
    </p>
    <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
    <p>
      I created the structure of the website to support the purposes and
      users&apos; intents.

    <h3>Tailored to First-Time Customers</h3>
    <p>
      We learned from the discovery sessions that the majority of the clients
      engage an interior designer for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tailored content such as Process Overview and Frequently-Asked Questions
      (FAQ) is produced to guide first-time customers through the user journey.
    </p>
    <Figure alt="Process overview" image={getImage(props.localImages[3])} />
    <h3>Conversion-Focused</h3>
    <p>
      Variations of call-to-actions are added appropriately to create an
      inclusive experience throughout the user journey.
    </p>
    <Figure alt="Call to actions" image={getImage(props.localImages[4])} />
    <h3>Optimised for Continuity</h3>
    <p>
      The flow of the post content is intentionally created as such users
      navigate through the space physically.

      The search window displays suggested search queries that match the
      user&apos;s intents.

    <h2>Visual Design</h2>
    <p>
      The new visual identity reflects the characteristics of contemporary
      design style widely present in their interior work. This particular style
      is defined by its simplicity, subtle sophistication, neutral colour
      scheme, and clean lines.

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      The initial phases have been decisive, given that the insights that we
      gathered had an influence on the project outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also had the opportunity to learn more about SEO and its processes,
      which will be valuable knowledge for a future project.
