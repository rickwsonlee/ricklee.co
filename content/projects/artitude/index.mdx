      The designers at Artitude Design Studio (aka Design Something) produce
      interiors that embody purposeful concepts and well-thought designs that
      stand the test of time. Having worked closely with them, their commitment
      and attention to detail are admirable.

      I was approached to develop a portfolio website as part of their ongoing
      effort to build their online presence. My tasks consist of conducting SEO
      research, structuring content, wireframing, designing mockups, and a
      fundamental visual identity that reflects their attitudes.
